# IntelliMerge Execution Steps 

In this README, we will provide an overview of the scripts results obtained from using the IntelliMerge tool, along with important information to understand and reproduce these results.

## Overview

[Describe briefly the purpose of the analysis or experiments conducted with the IntelliMerge tool.]

## How to Reproduce

If you wish to reproduce the results with the IntelliMerge tool, follow these steps:

1. **Prerequisites:**
   
    To obtain IntelliMerge simulation results:
    * Windows and Java 8 to execute IntelliMerge.
    * A list of merges containing merge parent 1 (p1), merge parent 2 (p2), and the merge commit.
  
    To analyze the IntelliMerge simulation result: </p>
    * Python and Pandas </br>

2. **Clone the IntelliMerge Repository:**

     ```bash
     git https://github.com/Symbolk/IntelliMerge.git

3. **Run the script to execute IntelliMerge simulation:**
      [intellimerge_script.sh](/intellimerge_execution/intellimerge_script.sh)
   ```bash
   .\intellimerge_script.sh
    
5. **Collect results from IntelliMerge execution using the scripts:**
