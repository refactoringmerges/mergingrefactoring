# Git Simulation 

In this README, we will provide an overview of the scripts results obtained from using the Git tool, along with important information to understand and reproduce these results.

## Overview

[Describe briefly the purpose of the analysis or experiments conducted with the Git tool.]

## How to Reproduce

If you wish to reproduce the results with the Git tool, follow these steps:

1. **Prerequisites:**
  To obtain Refactoring Analysis Tool simulation results:
  * Refactoring Analysis Tool:
      * Linux or macOS
      * git
      * Java 11
      * MySQL 5.7
 
  * To analyze the Git simulation results:
      * Python and Pandas

2. **Clone the RefactoringAbalysis Tool repository and follow the instructions on it:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ualberta-smr/RefactoringsInMergeCommits.git
  
   
4. **Collect results from Git execution using the script:**

      Regression model: git_merge_regression_model.ipynd
   
6. **Perform the analysis of Git results running the script:**
