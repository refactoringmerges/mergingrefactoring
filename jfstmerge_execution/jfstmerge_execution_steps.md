# jFSTMerge Execution Steps 

In this README, we will provide an overview of the scripts results obtained from using the IntelliMerge tool, along with important information to understand and reproduce these results.

## Overview

[Describe briefly the purpose of the analysis or experiments conducted with the jFSTMerge tool.]

## How to Reproduce

We executed jFSTMerge over our subjects using shell script, then we preprocessed the results using Python scripts.

1. **Prerequisites:**
   
    To obtain jFSTMerge simulation results:
    * Windows and Java 8 (Java version "1.8.0_212" or above) to execute jFSTMerge
    * Git (optional)
    * A file containing merge parent 1 (p1), merge parent 2 (p2), and the merge commit.
  
    To analyze the IntelliMerge simulation result: </p>
    * Python 
    * Pandas and related libraries

2. **Clone the jFSTMerge Repository:**
     ```bash
     git https://github.com/guilhermejccavalcanti/s3m.git

3. **Run the script to execute jFSTMerge:**
      ```bash
      .\jfst_script.sh
    
4. **Collect results from jFSTMerge execution using the scripts:**
